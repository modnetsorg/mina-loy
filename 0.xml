        <collex:text>Mina Loy Baedeker: Scholarly Handbook for Digital Travelers By Suzanne W. Churchill, Linda A. Kinnahan, and Susan Rosenbaum Preamble These are suspect places â Mina Loy, âSongs to Joannesâ Mina Loy Baedeker charts Loyâs navigation of Italian Futurism, New York Dada, and French and American Surrealism between the 1910s and the 1960s. Analyzing and interpreting her shifting avant-garde affiliations, experiments with genre and media, and geographic migrations, the chapters serve as a Scholarly Handbook for Digital Travelers. 3 baedekers The term âBaedekerâ emerged in 1826, when German publisher Verlag Karl Baedeker began to publish travel guides for cities around the world, which included introductions, fold-out maps, travel routes, and information about important sights and destinations, all written by experts. Popularly called âBaedekers,â the guides became best-sellers and were translated into multiple languages (Wikipedia). cover of Lunar Baedeker and Time-tablesMina Loy, a world-traveler, likely relied on the guides for practical advice. She also drew upon them for imaginative inspiration, adopting the phrase âLunar Baedekerââguidebook to the moonâfor the two volumes of her writing published in her lifetime: Lunar Baedecker [sic] (Contact Publishing Co., 1923). The Lunar Baedeker &amp; Time-Tables (Jonathan Williams, 1958) Posthumous collections of her work have used the same title phrase: The Last Lunar Baedeker (Jargon Society, 1982). The Lost Lunar Baedeker: Poems of Mina Loy (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1996). In calling our scholarly chapters a âMina Loy Baedeker,â we acknowledge Loyâs ingenious use of innovative forms to navigate real and imagined territory, as well as contemporary readersâ need for a new kind of handbook for navigating her complex archive. The Handbook is organized chronologically and geographically, following Loyâs movements through time and space. The chapters may be read consecutively, or navigate your own path. Note: In Spring 2019, Mina Loy Baedeker will be subjected to double-blind peer review by ModNets and a process of public peer review via Hypothes.is.</collex:text>
